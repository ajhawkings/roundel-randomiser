### A simple website made to help with the *Connecting London* board game

This website replaces the &apos;Good Service&apos; tiles, meaning you no longer
have to put them back in the bag and draw two new ones every turn. I
enjoy this game but found this process tedious, so this app speeds up
the gameplay and makes it work better for me!

## Development

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install packages with `npm i`
3. Run the dev server with    `npm run dev`
